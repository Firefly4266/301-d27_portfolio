U.Tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation - not because of the height of our skyscrapers, or the power of our military, or the size of our economy. It seems to me that each day, thousands of Americans are going about their lives - dropping the kids off at school, driving to work, shopping at the mall, trying to stay on their diets, trying to kick a cigarette habit - and they\'re coming to the realization that something is missing. At times, that anger is exploited by politicians, to gin up votes along racial lines, or to make up for a politician\'s own failings.And we should close Guantanamo Bay and stop tolerating the torture of our enemies. God is still speaking. But she didn\'t. And finally, just as America can never tolerate violence by extremists, we must never alter our principles.Louis, and thousands more like her, who has the grades, has the drive, has the will, but doesn\'t have the money to go to college.<img class="pull-right" src="images/DSC_0250.jpg" alt="she\'s_gone_but_not_forgotten"> The skeptical bent of my mind didn\'t suddenly vanish. People are coming together around a simple truth - that we are all connected, that I am my brother\'s keeper; I am my sister\'s keeper. It\'s been about you. Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.And that man is John Kerry. And it\'s a testament to what we can achieve when good people with strong convictions stand up for their beliefs. The fact is that the comments that have been made and the issues that have surfaced over the last few weeks reflect the complexities of race in this country that we\'ve never really worked through - a part of our union that we have yet to perfect. You make a big election about small things. But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring.</p>',
